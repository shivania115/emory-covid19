                      From Emory University

                      <br/>

                      </p>

                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      Amidst CDC recommended non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask wearing, 
                      hand washing, hand sanitizing and other measures taken by local, state and federal 
                      governments, the vaccines emerged as a valuable weapon against COVID-19. Ensuring 
                      equitable vaccine access remains a national priority and there have been major 
                      discussions regarding the best ways to address vaccine access in vulnerable 
                      communities. Nevertheless, CDC data suggest that vaccine administration is not 
                      just lower in some vulnerable communities, but also the gaps have been widening 
                      even further over time. We compared vaccination coverage across counties based on 
                      social characteristics-considering a combination of location (region, urbanicity) 
                      and population makeup (e.g., % African American, % Hispanic, % in poverty). 

                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      As per the 

                      <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e2.htm?s_cid=mm695152e2_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> recommendations </a>
                      
                      of Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the COVID-19 vaccinations 
                      were offered in three phases. Health care personnel, residents of long-term care 
                      facilities, persons aged 65 â 74 years, persons aged 16 â 64 years with high-risk
                       medical conditions, and essential workers were the  

                      <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e2.htm?s_cid=mm695152e2_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> first groups to receive the vaccines</a>. 
                      
                      This phased vaccine rollout provided guidance for federal, state and local governments 
                      while vaccine supply was limited. Owing to the intentionally targeted efforts to ensure 
                      that the population aged 65 and over were amongst the first communities to receive vaccines, 
                      it comes as no surprise that counties with higher population over the age of 65 years have 
                      had higher vaccination rates from the very beginning of the vaccine rollout.

                      With respect to racial and ethnic composition, counties with relatively high 
                      shares of American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) have consistently had higher 
                      population-level vaccination coverage. This success is largely attributed to strong 
                      implementation of vaccine distribution and prioritization strategies by the AIAN tribe 
                      community leaders. The Indian Health Service (IHS), a federal agency that maintains 
                      health service delivery system for American Indian and Alaska Natives, 

                      <a href="https://www.ihs.gov/sites/coronavirus/themes/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/COVID-19VaccineAllocationbyArea.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> were initially shipped 68,400 vaccines </a>
                      
                      which were distributed among the AIAN communities across 37 U.S. states when the vaccine 
                      rollout began. While counties with a relatively large share of Hispanic Americans were 
                      initially lagging in vaccination coverage, these counties began achieving higher than 
                      average vaccination coverage around mid-April.

                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      On the other hand, counties with a higher proportion of minority, African American and 
                      uninsured population as well as counties with higher proportion of population with 
                      underlying conditions and population in poverty have consistently reported lower vaccination 
                      coverage relative to the nation since the beginning of the  
                      
                      <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/12/health/covid-19-vaccine-comorbidities-states-cnn-analysis-wellness/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> rollout</a>. 

                      The persistent under-coverage of vaccination in these communities is particularly 
                      disconcerting because these counties have large shares of populations that are known 
                      to be vulnerable to severe COVID-19 outcomes, such as hospitalization and death. People 
                      with an underlying medical condition were even prioritized for early vaccination 
                      eligibility, and by the end of March, most U.S. states had expanded vaccination eligibility 
                      to individuals with underlying medical conditions. Yet, counties with a relatively larger 
                      proportion of residents with an underlying medical condition continue to lag behind the 
                      national average in vaccination.

                      <br/>
                      
                      We see similar gaps in rollout between counties with higher and lower proportion of 
                      African American population. In early April, Dr. Gary Bennette, from Duke University, in an 
                       
                      <a href="https://researchblog.duke.edu/2021/04/08/black-americans-vaccine-hesitancy-is-grounded-by-more-than-mistrust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> interview </a>

                      highlighted barriers in accessing health care services, mistrust, and uncertainties 
                      around vaccines as the root causes of increased vaccine hesitancy and, in turn, low 
                      vaccine turnout. Despite the national attention, the gap in vaccination continues to 
                      grow. Counties with higher proportion of African American population see 6% lower 
                      vaccination turnout compared to those with lower proportion. Among all minorities, 
                      except for Hispanic and American Native, we see similar trends in vaccination: counties 
                      with higher proportion of vulnerable communities are not hitting enough turnout.
                      
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      
                      When it comes to the impoverished and underserved communities, counties with a relatively 
                      larger proportion of residents living in poverty have fallen far behind the national 
                      average, and the gap even doubled between April and July. Limited access is just one of 
                      the many obstacles that the residents of those neighborhoods must deal with. Earlier in February, 
                       
                      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/health/white-people-covid-vaccines-minorities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> vaccination efforts for the impoverished </a>

                      hit with an influx of residents from other areas, further hindering the effort. These 
                      patterns also hold for counties with relatively high proportions of uninsured residents. 
                      Although the COVID-19 vaccine itself is freely available to even those without insurance, 
                      the time cost and transportation cost may be some of the barriers to receiving the vaccine in these communities.  
                                             
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      <br/>                  
                      
                      There also exists discrepancies in vaccination among the four regions of the U.S.: South, West
                      , Midwest, and Northeast. Counties in the US South have the lowest vaccinations per capita 
                      in the nation. The US South also has a disproportionately large number of counties that are 
                      classified as having high poverty and high uninsured populations (see

                      ). 
                      These maps reinforce a disconcerting pattern: the counties with the worst risk for severe 
                      COVID-19 disease and worst access to healthcare are the least vaccinated.

                      Most concerning challenges to vaccination hesitancy that has come up 
                      repeated in reports and articles, including this

                      from AJMC, consist of access to health care, mistrust in the medical establishment, and 
                      uncertainties about safety. The data clearly show that vaccination coverage to date has 
                      not been proportionate to the populations most in need of protection from this potentially 
                      deadly virus. New strategies are needed to close the gap in the COVID-19 vaccine across the United States.

                  Implementing state-wide mask mandate in the early stages of the pandemic may have been a clever move

                      <br/>

                      By October 31<sup>st</sup>, 2020, over 
                      <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 9,000,000 cases and 200,000 deaths 
                          </a> had occurred in the U.S., 
                      with cases and death rates consistently higher than in most other countries. The ongoing 
                      epidemic has demanded a comprehensive response from the federal, state, and local governments. 
                      It has also challenged governments to act in extraordinary ways to contain the spread of coronavirus. 
                      In addition to thorough handwashing, social distancing and mask wearing are the primary prevention 
                      strategies available to prevent SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19 disease) infection. 
                      In crises like this, citizens look to their governments for information, guidance, and safety. 
                      The coronavirus pandemic has affected nearly every nation in the world differently and each 
                      governmentâs response towards containing the pandemic has been equally distinct. 
                      This has been the case on a range of measures, including whether leaders implemented local mask mandates.


                
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      The shifting guidelines on mask use by the World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. 
                      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the early days of the pandemic 
                      precipitated confusion among the general public about the effectiveness and utility 
                      of face masks. Both 
                      <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/6/21282108/masks-for-covid-19-world-health-organizationguidelines-cloth-n95" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> WHO </a>
                       and 
                       <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2020/04/08/why-did-the-recommendation-on-wearing-face-masks-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> CDC </a>
                        had deemed the use of face masks unnecessary earlier 
                      in the pandemic but later changed their stance in early June 2020. Several studies on the 
                      effectiveness of masks in controlling the spread of COVID-19 resulted in 
                      <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/5/29/21273625/coronavirus-masks-required-virginia-china-hongkong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 15 U.S. states suddenly mandating mask use statewide </a>
                           in April, May, and June. Twelve other states followed 
                      in June, July, and August 2020. Despite 
                      <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> several strong pieces of evidence </a> on the 
                      effectiveness of masks in controlling spread, 18 states had failed to put a statewide 
                      order in place before the peak rose too high to be controlled by October 31<sup>st</sup>, 2020. There 
                      had been several additional studies of mask effectiveness done before the third wave hit. 
                      However, since November, almost all the states saw dramatic spikes in cases. Thus, as we 
                      consider additional measures to control the ongoing spread of COVID-19, we need to examine 
                      how mask mandates could have had important and lasting effects on recent trends in cases 
                      and the implications for the coming weeks and months. If mask mandates indeed are crucial 
                      in controlling the spread of COVID-19, we expect states with early mask mandates to have 
                      the lowest case rates (per 100,000) among them all. As we negotiate the added risks of 
                      infection from new and potentially more infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2, we revisit the 
                      efficacy of mask mandates to remind ourselves of the importance of mask-wearing and 
                      quantify the performance of statewide mask mandates in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. 

                      
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      To understand the impact of mask mandates, we compared the trend of COVID-19 
                      infection rates in the 15 states that first mandated mask usage statewide early 
                      in the pandemic (before the second wave hit in June) with other states that passed 
                      the statewide mask mandate order either during or after the second wave and with 
                      those that had not implemented statewide mask mandates as of October 31<sup>st</sup>, 2020. 
                      Since November 2020, there have been multiple events such as national elections, 
                      the Thanksgiving and end of year holidays, the end of the Fall semester for schools, 
                      and riots that could have contributed to the spike in COVID-19 cases. Thus, our 
                      window of analysis is cut off on October 31<sup>st</sup>, 2020 and we considered states that 
                      adopted a statewide order after November to be part of the group of states without 
                      mandates. Each wave of the pandemic is defined as the period from the point of 
                      lowest growth in daily cases in the previous period to the next peak. The states 
                      that passed statewide mask mandate orders in April and early May were classified as 
                      the âfirst group of states with mask mandates (Before the second wave).â Those that 
                      mandated mask use statewide between June 7 and July 19 make up the âsecond group of 
                      states with mask mandate (During the second wave).â Finally, we consider the states 
                      that mandated mask usage statewide after the second curve abated as the âthird group 
                      of states with mask mandate (After the second wave).â The states in each category are listed below in Table 1.

                      One major assumption we make is that mask mandates have a direct effect on 
                      local residentsâ behavior regarding mask-wearing. 15 states, including New York, 
                      New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, had implemented statewide 
                      mask mandates by the time first waveâs momentum halted in early June. Indeed, the first 
                      group of states that turned to mask mandates was the one that saw a spike in cases early 
                      on, but they were also the ones that limited the spike in case rate during the second wave. 
                      During the second wave, this group saw a flattened curve compared to states not yet 
                      implementing mandates, and the difference in case rate has grown only more separated 
                      since the start of the third wave. As of October 31<sup>st</sup>, the average case rate in states 
                      without mask mandates was approximately 50% more than (3,445 vs. 2,198 cases) that of 
                      states with the earliest mask mandates.

                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      
                      States that mandated mask use statewide in June, July, and August (the âsecond groupâ 
                      in our categorization), saw a minimal impact of the mandates on COVID-19 case rates in 
                      the few weeks that followed. While it may be tempting to discredit the effectiveness of 
                      these mandates, the differences have manifested since September as case rates in states 
                      without mask mandates skyrocketed. On October 31<sup>st</sup>, states with mask mandates during the 
                      second wave saw approximately 867 fewer cases per 100,000 compared to the group with no 
                      mask mandates. Similarly, states with statewide mask mandates after the second wave saw 
                      approximately 884 fewer cases per 100,000 compared to states without mask mandates. The 
                      average case rate across the group without mask mandates ticked up in the second half of 
                      October at an alarming rate while other groups with earlier mask mandates had a steady 
                      increase during the same period. This discrepancy sheds some light on the positive 
                      contribution that mask mandates might have played in containing the spread of the 
                      pandemic - even when the entire nation is experiencing worst of the pandemic.

                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      Multiple preventive guidelines beyond mask mandates could have contributed to 
                      controlling the SARS-CoV-2 virus, so it is difficult to assess what proportion of 
                      case control is due solely to mask mandates. For example, states that adopted early 
                      mask mandates may have also been more likely to adopt other simultaneous mitigation 
                      measures. Similarly, those states may have residents that are more compliant with 
                      public health guidance and invested in community-wide mitigation, which would allow 
                      decision-makers the political will to implement such measures in the first place. 
                      Nevertheless, the timing of mask mandates and the subsequent changes in the growth 
                      of case rates align. States that implemented statewide mask mandates saw a slower 
                      growth in cases compared to those that did not, not just in the weeks that followed 
                      the mandates, but for months after. The discrepancies in case rate trends affirm the 
                      correlation between mask mandates and COVID-19 case rate, but they also highlight 
                      that a lack thereof puts states in precarious situations.

                      It has been over a year since the first COVID-19 case was discovered in the 
                      United States, and now the pandemic has reached new heights with increasing 
                      concerns about potential new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Statewide mask 
                      mandates assert statesâ positions on following guidelines and could be game 
                      changing towards flattening the curve in states that are currently experiencing 
                      the worst of the pandemic. As vaccination slowly catches up, it remains critical 
                      to mandate masks, protecting each otherâs health and buying time for greater 
                      vaccine uptake. Far too many lives have been lost, and there is no timetable for 
                      the end of this calamity. We just might get a glimpse of the light at the end of 
                      tunnel if we take all the necessary courses of action now.

                      COVID-19 is affecting every community differently. The COVID-19 Health Equity 
                      Dashboard compiles publicly available data from across the United States to 
                      track COVID-19 infections and deaths across counties while considering demographic, social, and economic context.

                      Since COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic took off in the United States in 2020, 
                      data continue to show that poverty, lack of health insurance, socioeconomic 
                      vulnerability, and housing insecurity may all contribute to higher risk of 
                      contracting COVID-19 and having severe outcomes. In the United States, 
                      approximately 12 percent of people are experiencing poverty, 8.5 percent do 
                      not have health insurance; 10 to 15 percent experience housing insecurity, 
                      and 8 percent are unemployed (up from a high of nearly 15% in April) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. 
                      These issues are related. As the pandemic affects businesses and employment, the 
                      cycle of poverty may be reinforced.

                      and then selecting â% Povertyâ in âCOVID-19 County Population Characteristics,â 
                      you can map these relationships. Cases per 100,000 (left) track with poverty

                      COVID-19 is affecting every community differently. The COVID-19 Health Equity Dashboard 
                      compiles publicly available data from across the United States to track COVID-19 infections 
                      and deaths across counties while considering demographic, social, and economic context.

                      <br/>

                      Since COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic took off in the United States in 2020, data continue 
                      to show that Native Americans, particularly in the Southwest, are disproportionately 
                      impacted by infection and death. Contributing factors may include high rates of poverty 
                      and chronic disease, lack of critical infrastructure like running water, isolation from 
                      health resources, crowded and multigenerational living conditions, and close-knit community 
                      support systems.
                      
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      Despite many of these Native American communities being located in rural areas, 
                      the low population density has not had a protective effect against infection as seen 
                      elsewhere in the country. The COVID-19 fatality rate (meaning the percentage of people 
                      who test positive who have died) in the state of Arizona is 2.5 percent [1], whereas in 
                      Navajo Nation (located primarily in Arizona as well as the other Four Corners states), 
                      it is 5.3 percent [2].

                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      Looking at county comparisons on the COVID-19 Health Equity Dashboard, we can find visual 
                      representations of these statistics across many states.

                      â% Native Americanâ in âCOVID-19 County Population Characteristics,â you can map these 
                      relationships. Deaths per 100,000 (left) track with the Native American population (right) 
                      in Arizona. So do poverty, diabetes, and socioeconomic vulnerability.

                      death rate is lower overall. Deaths per 100,000 tracks with the Native American 
                      population, and lack of insurance tracks with cases per 100,000.

                      COVID-19 is affecting every community differently. The COVID-19 Health Equity Dashboard compiles publicly 
                      available data from across the United States to track COVID-19 infections and deaths across 
                      counties while considering demographic, social, and economic context.

                      <br/>

                      Since COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic took off in the United States in 2020, data continue 
                      to show that African Americans are disproportionately impacted by infection and death. 
                      In the US, African Americans have contracted COVID-19 at 2.6 times the rate of white 
                      non-Hispanic people, are hospitalized at 4.7 times the rate, and die at 2.1 times the 
                      rate [1]. Per 100,000, 88 African Americans have died versus 40 white Americans. African 
                      Americans have the highest rate of death of any racial or ethnic group in the United States [2]. 
                      At a community-level, this manifests  as a striking visual correlation between the proportion 
                      of a county that is African American and its per capita cases of COVID-19.

                      Looking at county comparisons on the COVID-19 Health Equity Dashboard, 
                      we can find visual representations of these statistics across many states.

                      â% African Americanâ in âCOVID-19 County Population Characteristics,â you can map these 
                      relationships. Cases per 100,000 (left) track with the African American population (right)

                      COVID-19 is affecting every community differently. The COVID-19 Health Equity Dashboard compiles publicly

                      <br/>

                      There are a lot of underlying conditions that may predispose certain people to develop severe COVID-19 
                      infection and be at a higher risk of hospitalization and death. These include having underlying health 
                      conditions like obesity and diabetes, and being over 65 years old. Since COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic 
                      took off in the United States in 2020, data continue to show that people with underlying conditions are 
                      disproportionately impacted by infection and death.

                      <br/>

                      42% of US adults have obesity, and data shows that especially among adults under age 60 and who are male, 
                      obesity leads to higher mortality among those with COVID-19 [1]. Due to the impact of obesity on the 
                      immune systems, individuals with obesity may also be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection in the first place.

                      Age is also a risk factor for COVID-19 due to older individuals having less robust immune systems and 
                      higher prevalence of comorbidities.

                      In the United States, 15% of the population is over age 65, but 80% of COVID-19 deaths have been in 
                      people over age 65 [3]. Visually, however, this is hard to see in state maps, because older people 
                      disproportionately live in rural parts of the country, and COVID-19 disproportionately affects urban 
                      areas due to population density. The map on the left shows the US population density per county and 
                      the right shows percent of the population over 65 years old.

                      College football season is approaching, but the COVID-19 pandemic still looms large in the United States. 
                      The ability for colleges to pursue a 2020-2021 football season remains unclear, as it seems impossible to 
                      maintain student-athlete safety during practices and games. While some of the Power Five conferences like
                      the Big Ten and Pac-12 have switched to conference-only games, other conferences are pushing their season
                      to start late, at the end of September, or waiting until Spring 2021 to play any games. The unavoidable
                      fact remains that there is no way to maintain physical distancing between players during practices and
                      games. In the absence of a vaccine, physical distancing is the only way to prevent community spread, 
                      and this necessity clashes with the reality of college football. 
                
                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      According to <a style ={{color: "#397AB9"}} href="http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/ncaa-demographics-database" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> NCAA Demographics Database</a>, almost half of all college football players in the United States 
                      are African Americans. Meanwhile, African Americans only make up 13% of the US population as per <a style ={{color: "#397AB9"}} href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> American Community Survey </a>
                      by the U.S. Census Bureau. <a style ={{color: "#397AB9"}} href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.13271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Research from Italy and Germany</a> has highlighted the heightened 
                      risk of infection posed by playing college football, a strenuous exercise makes athletes more likely to inhale 
                      virus particles to the lower areas of their lungs - putting athletes such as football players at a higher risk 
                      of infection as they share close airspace on playing fields. Therefore, playing college football is an occupational 
                      risk for COVID-19 that disproportionately falls on African American young men.

                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      The college football scenario mirrors the disparate impact of the pandemic across American communities, 
                      <a style ={{color: "#397AB9"}} href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/coronavirus-is-hitting-black-and-hispanic-americans-way-harder-cdc-data-shows?ref=scroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> with significantly higher rates of infection and death seen in many marginalized populations</a>
                      , including 
                      African Americans. Mortality rate in African Americans continue to rise and is 
                      <a style ={{color: "#397AB9"}} href="https://covidtracking.com/race" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 2.5 times as high as White Americansâ mortality rates. </a>
                      As communities of color grapple with higher infection rates caused by a wide 
                      range of factors, including higher participation in essential occupations and higher levels of underlying 
                      chronic disease, poverty, and constrained access to healthcare, it is important to give special consideration 
                      to the health of African American student athletes and occupational risk posed by college football season.

                      In order to make an informed decision about how the college football season can proceed, it is important 
                      to understand the status of COVID-19 outbreaks in the counties where the Power Five schools are located 
                      and to account for interstate travel. To find out how these counties are affected by COVID-19, we used 
                      data compiled through 
                      <a style ={{color: "#397AB9"}} href="http://covid19.emory.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The COVID-19 Health Equity Dashboard </a>
                      to compare the COVID-19 infections and deaths 
                      in these counties with the rest of the counties in the country (Figure 1), adjusted for population. The 
                      analysis was then repeated to investigate how per capita infections and deaths compared across counties 
                      in each of the Power Five Conferences (Figure 2).

                      <br/>

                      We found that COVID-19 infection and mortality rates in the total population were much higher in counties 
                      with the Power Five Schools compared to those without. We performed a statistical test (Welch t-test) to 
                      assess whether the mean difference between COVID-19 per capita infections and deaths were due to the huge 
                      difference in the number of counties with and without D1 football teams.  

                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      Our data as of August 16, 2020 suggests that counties with the Power Five schools are more affected 
                      by COVID-19. These counties have 19% higher COVID-19 cases per capita 
                      and 12% higher COVID-19 deaths per capita than the rest of the country. Notably, the Atlantic Coast Conference 
                      (ACC) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) schools are located in the counties most affected by COVID-19. Respectively, 
                      these counties have approximately 25% and 63% more COVID-19 cases per capita than counties without the Power Five schools. 
                      The Welch t-test demonstrates that these differences are indeed statistically significant. This raises 
                      the question of whether it would be safe to bring student-athletes back to counties that are already 
                      hard-hit by COVID-19.

                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      Even if the ACC and SEC decide to play conference-only games, there is still a high risk of infection for 
                      everyone playing within the conference due to lack of social distancing and high infection rates in these 
                      counties. Nevertheless, economic implications are large; for example, a âno-goâ decision from any of the 
                      three remaining powerhouse conferences could cost the city of Atlanta $100 million in expected revenue from 
                      hosting games in the first week of conference play. However, it is reckless to risk the lives of athletes to 
                      ensure the college sportsâ revenue streams. With athlete scholarships tied to team membership, conferences 
                      and schools must find a balance between supporting educational opportunities for student athletes while not 
                      unduly exposing student athletes to additional risk of COVID-19 infection. And, the outcome of these decisions 
                      will have a significant impact on students of color, who make up a large share of student athletes.
