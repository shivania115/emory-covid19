  step2_8:
    "These vaccines are given as a shot in the muscle of the upper arm or in the thigh of a young child. COVID-19 vaccine ingredients are considered safe for most people. Nearly all of the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are ingredients found in many foods—fats, sugar, and salts. **None of the COVID-19 vaccines affect or interact with our DNA** and the following are not included in the vaccines:",

    " Is the COVID-19 vaccine effective in protecting people against getting COVID-19?",
  step2_18:
    "Yes, COVID 19-vaccines are effective at protecting people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and dying. Vaccination remains the safest strategy for avoiding hospitalizations, long-term health outcomes, and death.",
  step2_19:
    "For both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, two doses are required to be fully protected from COVID-19. Individuals are not considered to be “vaccinated” until after they receive their second dose.",
  step2_20:
    "For the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, only one dose is needed. For all vaccines, it takes around two weeks after vaccination to be fully protected.",
  step2_21: "Can the vaccine make me sick with COVID-19?",
  step2_22:
    "No. The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain COVID-19 virus particles that could cause the disease.",
  step2_left1:
    "COVID-19 vaccines train our bodies to recognize and fight the virus. They do this by teaching our immune system to target an important part of the virus",
  step2_left2:
    "Vaccination means you will be less likely to catch COVID-19 and pass it on to others. In the small chance that you catch the virus, your symptoms will usually be mild.",
  step2_left3: " The vaccines mostly widely available for adults in US are:",
  step2_23q: "Are the approved COVID-19 vaccines safe?",
  step2_23:
    "Yes. Any vaccine that is approved for use is thoroughly tested to make sure that it is both effective and safe. Tests for safety already happen in Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III clinical trials. However, vaccines continue to be tested for safety after they are approved for use, in what are called “Phase IV” studies. All the vaccines for COVID-19 are being developed through careful scientific studies, which follow strict standards set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). During vaccine development and testing, researchers carefully study whether each vaccine effectively reduces the chances of getting COVID-19 or getting sick from COVID-19. Researchers have tested the vaccines on thousands of study participants during Phases I-III. Researchers also track whether a vaccine causes side effects, the kind of side effects people experience, and how serious those are. All of the side effects are reported to doctors making the decision about whether the vaccine is safe.",
  step2_24:
    "There are very strict standards about whether a vaccine is authorized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration. Before a COVID-19 vaccine is approved, scientists must show that any risks of side effects from the vaccine are outweighed by its benefits and by the potential harm of getting sick from COVID-19. You can find additional information about COVID-19 vaccine safety on the [CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html) and the full documents shared with the FDA [here](https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download) for the Moderna vaccine, [here](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and [here](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download) for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Vaccine safety monitoring does not stop once a vaccine is approved. It continues on a larger scale with Phase IV studies as well as nationwide vaccine safety reporting systems. ",
  step2_25:
    " There are multiple systems used to track any reports of any adverse side effects or reactions. The Vaccine Safety Datalink which helps to determine whether the reactions reported using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) are related to a vaccine. The Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project also helps to track and evaluate issues of vaccine safety. You can find out more about these and other different systems at CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and other groups used to monitor and assess safety [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html).",
  step2_26q:
    "What is the difference between an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine and a booster?",
  step2_26:
    " Right now, the FDA and CDC have authorized and recommended additional doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty) or Moderna (Spikevax) vaccines in certain circumstances. While both terms currently refer to a third shot, there are some differences in why an “additional dose” or a “booster dose” are recommended.",
  step2_27:
    "An additional dose of vaccine (i.e. a third dose of the Pfizer or Moderna two-shot vaccines in this case, received 28 days at least after the second dose) is authorized by [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-vaccine-dose-certain-immunocompromised) outside the United States and recommended by [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) for people who have moderately or severely compromised immune systems, who may not have built up high enough immunity from the first two shots.",
  // step2_28:'A booster shot (i.e. another dose of one of the available vaccines at least 5 months after getting a full primary series of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna two-shot vaccines or at least 2 months after the Johnson &Johnson/ Janssen one-shot vaccine) is authorized by [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-booster-dose-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-certain-populations) and recommended by [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0924-booster-recommendations-.html) for everyone. In this case, the booster counters the decrease in immunity that was developed after becoming fully vaccinated. Studies have shown that vaccine-induced protection from COVID-19 illness decreases over time and may also be decreased by newer variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The reduction in immunity is primarily a reduction in protection from symptomatic COVID-19 illness;however, protection from more serious illness and outcomes does also decrease somewhat over time. In some [cases](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html#second-booster), a second booster is also recommended.' ,
  step2_28:
    "People aged 6 months and older are recommended to receive an updated booster dose at least 2 months after receiving first two vaccinations or from last booster shot. Two COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer and Moderna, have developed updated COVID-19 boosters. The booster counters the decrease in immunity that was developed after becoming fully vaccinated. Studies have shown that vaccine-induced protection from COVID-19 illness decreases over time and may also be decreased by newer variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The reduction in immunity is primarily a reduction in protection from symptomatic COVID-19 illness; however, protection from more serious illness and outcomes does also decrease somewhat over time.

  step3_pfizer:
    "The vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech is known as 'Comirnaty', or BNT162b2, or most commonly as 'the Pfizer vaccine'. It is an mRNA vaccine which means it uses genetic code from a part of the virus to train your immune system. The genetic code is quickly broken down by the body and cleared away. You can not catch COVID-19 from Comirnaty (Pfizer). After the second dose, Comirnaty (Pfizer) is around 90% effective against the Delta variant in children. 1-2 Effectiveness against Omicron is still unknown but if you catches COVID-19 after you've been vaccinated, your illness will usually be mild.",
  step3_moderna:
    "Spikevax is a vaccine developed by Moderna. It is also known as 'the Moderna vaccine'. It is an mRNA vaccine which means it uses genetic code from a part of the virus to train your immune system. The genetic code is quickly broken down by your body and cleared away. You can not catch COVID-19 from Spikevax (Moderna). After the second dose, Spikevax (Moderna) is about 94%  effective against COVID-19. It may be slightly less effective against more recent variants, such as the Delta variant, but it will still protect you against serious illness and reduce your risk of hospitalisation and death.",
