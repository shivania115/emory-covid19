                      to the safety of this vaccine on 23 April 2021, the

                      vaccines have shown that they are very effective in
                      preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease (95% and 94.1%
                      effective, respectively). The Johnson & Johnson vaccine
                      showed that it was also quite effective in preventing
                      severe COVID-19 illness (85% effective), as well as
                      preventing less severe illness. All three vaccines have
                      also shown that they are safe to get. However, there are a
                      few small differences in who should get them and when. The
                      most important ones for anyone getting a vaccine are the

                      not “permanent”. In fact, it is quite fragile and breaks
                      down quickly after it has triggered the body to make the

                      approved for use against any disease, scientists have been

                      technology and materials they use, mRNA vaccines can also
                      be developed more quickly against new viruses than other
                      types of vaccines, as they were against COVID-19.

        It is hard to know exactly how effective the authorized vaccines will be against new and different variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. 
        Right now, the limited information we have suggests that the immune protection both from natural infection (i.e. actually getting COVID-19) or 
        from vaccination will still protect against most new variants. However, this is a changing situation, and something scientists are continuing to study.

        During clinical trials, the top priority is safety of the participants. The clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccines are no different. 
        It is normal for a clinical trial to be temporarily paused when a possible side effect (or “adverse event”) is found. This pause happens so that the side effect can be investigated fully, 
        to see if it is really related to the vaccine, or to something else. This is done by doctors and an independent monitoring board of other scientists, not by the pharmaceutical company. 
        Clinical trials are specifically designed to allow for potential pauses, so that they can put patient safety at the absolute top of the priority list.

                      As soon as the virus was identified as SARS-CoV-2 in early
                      2020, many researchers around the world began to work on
                      mapping out its genetic code. Because scientists were
                      already familiar with coronaviruses, the virus family
                      SARS-CoV-2 belongs to, and because they collaborated on
                      this work, they were able to identify its viral sequence
                      incredibly quickly. The technologies for the different
                      types of vaccines (mRNA, viral vector, and others) were
                      already being tested on other viruses and in other areas
                      of medicine. They were rapidly adapted against SARS-CoV-2
                      once scientists had its viral sequence fully mapped out.

                      Because of the global urgency to fight the COVID-19
                      pandemic, researchers received very large amounts of
                      funding from governments and private sector investors.
                      Partnerships were also developed between groups of
                      institutions to plan ahead in case the vaccines that were
                      being developed and tested proved to be effective. In the
                      United States, one such partnership was Operation Warp
                      Speed. This collaboration brought together components of
                      the Department of Health and Human Services and the

                      question. Whether or not a vaccine is effective against a
                      variant depends both on the specific vaccine and the
                      specific variant. While the available vaccines,
                      particularly the two mRNA vaccines do provide very good
                      protection against severe illness and death, including
                      against the most common variant, known as the Delta
                      variant. However, some variants, including the Delta
                      variant, could still be transmitted to others by people
                      who are vaccinated. As a result,{" "}

                      information that the benefits of the vaccine are greater

                      Yes. Any vaccine that is approved for use is thoroughly
                      tested to make sure that it is both effective and safe.
                      Tests for safety already happen in Phase I, Phase II, and
                      Phase III clinical trials. However, vaccines continue to
                      be tested for safety after they are approved for use, in
                      what are called “Phase IV” studies. All the vaccines for
                      COVID-19 are being developed through careful scientific
                      studies, which follow strict standards set by the Food and
                      Drug Administration (FDA). During vaccine development and
                      testing, researchers carefully study whether each vaccine
                      effectively reduces the chances of getting COVID-19 or
                      getting sick from COVID-19. Researchers have tested the
                      vaccines on thousands of study participants during Phases
                      I-III. Researchers also track whether a vaccine causes
                      side effects, the kind of side effects people experience,
                      and how serious those are. All of the side effects are
                      reported to doctors making the decision about whether the
                      vaccine is safe.

                      Before a COVID-19 vaccine is approved, scientists must
                      show that any risks of side effects from the vaccine are

                      Yes. In April 2021, the FDA and CDC recommended pausing
                      the distribution of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to allow
                      the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
                      (ACIP) to investigate extremely rare reports of
                      individuals experiencing blood clotting events after
                      having received this vaccine (6 reports after 6.8 million
                      vaccine doses were administered). These reports were
                      identified through the careful monitoring of side effects
                      and serious reactions being recorded via the Vaccine
                      Adverse Event Reporting System (or VAERS). This is a very
                      good sign that not only is the monitoring working to catch
                      any rare reactions to the vaccine but also that the FDA

                      During two meetings, the ACIP reviewed the reports of
                      blood clots and any other reports of adverse reactions to
                      the vaccines. They reassessed how serious and common any
                      risks linked to receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine
                      might be, including the likelihood of having this rare
                      type of blood clot. They also considered the benefits of
                      being vaccinated against COVID-19 and the risks associated
                      with not being vaccinated. The cases of these rare blood
                      clots (called cerebral venous sinus thromboses or CVST)
                      were all among women aged 18-59. The review concluded that
                      the vaccine was safe and effective against COVID-19 and
                      that its benefits outweigh any known or potential risks in
                      all approved age groups and in both men and women.

                      Getting two different types of vaccines will likely not
                      give you more protection than one type of vaccine. The

                      Yes. Since COVID-19 is a new virus, we do not know how
                      long immunity (or protection) someone gets from having an
                      infection lasts. In general, immunity after an infection
                      depends on both the disease and the individual. So far,
                      based on evidence from a small number of people, it seems
                      like immunity from a COVID-19 infection may not last very
                      long. More research is needed to understand this fully and
                      to get a clearer sense of how long it might last. Because
                      we do not yet know how long this immunity will last, it is
                      still important to get vaccinated even if you had COVID-19
                      and recovered.

                      However, if you currently have COVID-19, you should wait
                      to get vaccinated until you feel better and your isolation
                      period is over. If you were treated with antibody therapy
                      during your COVID-19 illness, you should wait until 90
                      days after you received this treatment to get vaccinated.
                      There is data suggesting that getting re-infected with
                      COVID-19 within 90 days following infection is uncommon.
                      As a result, some people may choose to wait 90 days after
                      they have recovered from COVID-19 before getting
                      vaccinated.

                      reported that these lasted a day or less.

                      A severe allergic reaction will usually happen within a
                      few minutes to an hour after getting vaccinated. Your
                      healthcare provider may ask you to stay at the place where
                      you received your vaccine for a short time so that they
                      can make sure you are safe when you leave. This is
                      particularly important if you have had allergic reactions
                      in the past. If you have had an allergic reaction to a
                      vaccine in the past, you should let your healthcare
                      provider know ahead of time. Signs of a severe allergic
                      reaction can include:

                      COVID-19. The reduction in immunity is mostly a reduction
                      in protection from symptomatic COVID-19 illness;

                      At this time, vaccine boosters have only been authorized
                      by the FDA for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It is likely
                      that other COVID-19 vaccines will also present data and
                      seek authorization for boosters but that is not currently
                      the case. It seems likely that boosters will be
                      recommended for similar groups who received one of the
                      other COVID-19 vaccines and guidance will be updated once
                      that has been reviewed by the FDA and CDC.

                      is very high in communities across the United States right
                      now and the Delta variant transmits more easily from
                      person to person. As such, CDC still recommends continuing
                      to physically distance, wear a face covering, limit
                      gatherings, and wash your hands thoroughly even once you
                      are vaccinated, including after receiving both doses for
                      the two-dose vaccines. Even though increasing numbers of
                      people across the United States are fully vaccinated as
                      the pandemic changes and transmission remains high, it is
                      important that people continue to follow these
                      precautions. The vaccine is the first part in a “one-two
                      punch” that also includes physical distancing, wearing a
                      mask, washing your hands regularly, and staying away from
                      large gatherings.

                      </a>
                      are that you should wear a mask indoors in public for 14
                      days after you are exposed or until you get a negative
                      COVID-19 test. You should also get tested 3-5 days after
                      your exposure, even if you do not have any symptoms. If
                      your test is positive, you should isolate for 10 days.

                        You have been fully vaccinated (received both shots if the COVID-19 vaccine you are getting is a two-dose vaccine) more than 2 weeks ago

                      Transmission of COVID-19 is very high across the country so CDC still recommends quarantining if you are exposed through a close contact and do not meet all 3 of these conditions.
